## Introduction

OpenEmbedded/Yocto Project BSP layer for Third-Party Maintained Qualcomm based
platforms.

This layer provides additional recipes and machine configuration files for
Third-Party Maintained Qualcomm platforms. Reference boards that are officially
supported by Qualcomm are available via [`meta-qcom`](https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom) instead.

This layer depends on:

```text
URI: https://github.com/openembedded/openembedded-core.git
layers: meta
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: https://github.com/qualcomm-linux/meta-qcom.git
branch: master
revision: HEAD
```

## Build an image

Build a RUBIK Pi 3 image with [kas-container](https://github.com/siemens/kas)
from the directory that contains your clone, which also receives the build:

```sh
kas-container build meta-qcom-3rdparty/ci/rubikpi3.yml
```

The [build tutorial](docs/source/user/USAGE.md) lists the prerequisites, the
files the build produces, and how long the build takes.

## Branches

- **main:** Primary development branch, with focus on upstream support and
  compatibility with the most recent Yocto Project release.
- **wrynose:** LTS branch based on the Yocto Project 6.0 release, used by
  Qualcomm Linux 2.x.
- **scarthgap:** Qualcomm Linux >= 1.4, aligned with Yocto Project 5.0 (LTS).
- **kirkstone:** Qualcomm Linux <= 1.3, aligned with Yocto Project 4.0 (LTS).

## Machine Support

See `conf/machine` for the complete list of supported devices.

## Contributing

Please read [docs/source/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/source/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution
workflow, the layer scope rules and the commit subject and message
requirements before opening a pull request.

## Documentation

Build the documentation site from the repository root, then open
`docs/site/index.html` directly in a browser:

```sh
make -f docs/source/Makefile setup html
```

The [documentation guide](docs/README.md) lists the build prerequisites and where
the source lives.

- [Build tutorial](docs/source/user/USAGE.md) — Build an image for a supported board.
- [Configuration reference](docs/source/user/CONFIGURATION.md) — Settings in the layer, machine, kas, and kernel files.
- [Development setup](docs/source/contributing/DEVELOPMENT.md) — Prepare a checkout, run the layer checks, and build the documentation.
- [Agent guide](docs/source/contributing/AGENTS.md) — Run builds and checks the same way CI does.
